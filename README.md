# CX
i'm (planning to) make this language

it's going to have every feature i can think of (for an imperative + functional + object oriented + \[others idk] language)

like:
- incremental compilation
- static verification
- runtime polymorphism?
- idk maybe there's more

however, as you can (probably) see, i have barely written any code for this (and the code i have written is getting replaced with [parserlang](https://github.com/RbCaVi/parserlang))

so i guess wait 2 years for me to come back to this </3
